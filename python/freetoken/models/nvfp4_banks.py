    (fp8 block scales) and ``_global`` (the per-tensor scale, reciprocal for quant-side dialects,
    fp16) companions, straight from the safetensors shards.

    Serial reads walk the shards in order; ``parallel`` uses the chunked O_DIRECT reader. Either
    way tensors of one expert may span shards, so they are grouped by (layer, expert) as they land.

    ``ownership`` (owner-local TP+EP): keep only this rank's experts and renumber them into the
    rank-local bank rows ``[0, local_num_experts)``, so the pieces land in the owner-local banks
    the cache actually allocates. Without it every expert is loaded at its global row.

    ``skip_experts_from`` (the disk tier): experts ``[skip_experts_from, E)`` are disk-resident.
    The serial reader never calls ``get_tensor`` for them (no I/O); the parallel reader filters
    them at the reader (the whole-shard read is unchanged, but no per-expert work happens). Each
    skipped expert still yields an EMPTY piece so the bank fill completes the layer without
    touching the (released) tail rows. Under ``ownership`` the skip range is global, and the
    empty pieces are renumbered into rank-local rows like the read ones.
